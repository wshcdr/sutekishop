# WTF is a suteki?? #

_Suteki_ is a Japanese word meaning 'cool!' or 'neat!'. The Japanese usually pronounce it with a long s and a silent u, so it sounds like ssstecki.

Why did I choose this name for this project? Well it's the same name I've been using for my little consulting company for years, and that came about because it was my Japanese girlfriend's favourite word :)
